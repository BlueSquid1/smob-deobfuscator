## Intro
This tool can be used to deobfuscate Smob. 

Smob is a Mod obfuscation tool created by Kirlif.

The deobfuscation support is up to v1.4

Note: this deobfuscator is only ~99% perfect. So expect some manual work required.

## Background
.smali are files that can be generated by unpacking a .apk. You can generated them by running:

```
apktool d <app>.apk
```


## Usage
```
python3 deobfuscation.py <path to .smali files> <output path>
```

I also created a script to perform a diff on two folders of .smali files:
```
python3 deltas.py <first path to .smali files> <second path to .smali files> <output folder>
```

Note: for performance I recommend running the deobfuscation.py first on both the obfuscated binary and the origional binary before performing a diff.


## Clinton's notes

Depending on what you are doing you might have to remove cert pinning on the app. If this is needed run:
or to remove certificate pinning:
```
apk-mitm --tmp-dir ./<app> --wait --keep-tmp-dir --debuggable --certificate ./mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem ./<app>.apk
```

- Getting <app> to compile
open up:
./res/values-v31/colors.xml
replace
```
@android
```
with:
```
@*android
```

open up:
./AndroidManifest.xml
delete
```
android:localeConfig="@xml/locales_config"
```

```
apktool b --use-aapt2 <app>
apksigner sign --ks ./keystore/Untitled --in ./<app>/dist/<app>.apk --out ./<app>/dist/<app>-signed.apk
adb install ./<app>/dist/<app>-signed.apk
adb shell am start -n com.<app>.music/com.<app>.music.MainActivity
adb logcat --pid=2967
```
